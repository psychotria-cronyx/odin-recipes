# odin-recipes
Project 1 (Recipes) | The Odin Project

This project is to display my learning progress in HTML syntax, semantics and file structure. 

By no means is this project suppose to "look pretty"

During this lesson, i also aim to understand git basics ie. setting up a repo, cloning to my local machine, adding regular commits and clear comments. 

--------------------------------------------------


INSTRUCTIONS BY ODIN CURRICULUM 
Iteration 1: initial structure

    Within the odin-recipes directory, create an index.html file.
    Fill it out with the usual boilerplate HTML and add an h1 heading “Odin Recipes” to the body.

Iteration 2: recipe page

    Create a new directory within the odin-recipes directory and name it recipes.
    Create a new HTML file within the recipes directory and name it after the recipe it will contain. For example lasagna.html. You can use the name of your favorite dish or, if you need some inspiration, you can find a recipe to use at Allrecipes.
    For now, just include an h1 heading with the recipe’s name as its content.
    Back in the index.html file, add a link to the recipe page you just created. Example: Under the <h1>Odin Recipes</h1> heading, write out the link like so: <a href="recipes/recipename.html">Recipe Title</a>. The text of the link should again be the recipe name.

Iteration 3: recipe page content

Your new recipe page should have the following content:

    An image of the finished dish under the h1 heading that you added earlier. You can find images of the dish on Google or Allrecipes.

    Under the image, it should have an appropriately sized “Description” heading followed by a paragraph or two describing the recipe.

    Under the description, add an “Ingredients” heading followed by an unordered list of the ingredients needed for the recipe.

    Finally, under the ingredients list, add a “Steps” heading followed by an ordered list of the steps needed for making the dish.

Iteration 4: add more recipes

    Add two more recipes with identical page structures to the recipe page you’ve already created.
    Don’t forget to link to the new recipes on the index page. Also, consider putting all the links in an unordered list so they aren’t all on one line.

Some reflection: 
This project was a bit of a breeze so far - i will come back to add styles. I read the instructions after the project on the bit re deployment. Couldn't help myself but display block in html so it wasn't an eyesore. I really picked up implementing git and comments throughout my project which i liked. I also think i have a better understanding of nesting lists inside of lists and setting up file structure which is what i planned for in this lesson. I came across an error changing the name of my repo and moving it into another directory which i successfully trouble shooted. Looking forward to the next project and also coming back to fix this up with styles and js later in the course.
