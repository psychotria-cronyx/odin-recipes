      Pad Thai is a quintessential Thai stir-fried noodle dish that harmoniously
      balances sweet, sour, and savory flavors. This vibrant dish features rice
      noodles tossed with shrimp or chicken, tofu, and a medley of fresh
      vegetables, all enveloped in a tangy tamarind sauce. Topped with crushed
      peanuts, bean sprouts, and lime wedges, Pad Thai is not just a meal; it’s
      an experience that showcases the rich culinary heritage of Thailand.
