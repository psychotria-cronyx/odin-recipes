        Tom Yum is a quintessential Thai soup known for its bold and aromatic
        flavors. This hot and sour soup typically features fresh ingredients
        like lemongrass, kaffir lime leaves, galangal, and a variety of
        proteins, often shrimp or chicken. Its distinctive taste comes from a
        perfect balance of spiciness, acidity, and herbal freshness, making it a
        favorite both in Thailand and around the world.

      <p>
        The soup is not just a dish; it’s a celebration of Thailand's culinary
        heritage, embodying the country’s love for vibrant flavors. Often
        enjoyed as a starter or a light meal, Tom Yum is best served hot,
        garnished with fresh cilantro and sometimes chili paste for an extra
        kick. Its versatility allows for variations, but the authentic version
        captures the essence of Thai cooking.

        <li>Prepare the Broth</li>
        <ul class="nested-ul">
          <li>
            In a pot, bring the chicken or vegetable broth to a boil. Add the

            balance
