        Green curry chicken is a flavorful Thai dish that balances spicy, sweet,
        and savory elements. It combines tender pieces of chicken with fresh
        vegetables, simmered in a creamy coconut milk base infused with aromatic
        green curry paste, lemongrass, and kaffir lime leaves. The dish is
        typically served with jasmine rice, offering a rich and fragrant meal.
        Perfect for those seeking a blend of heat and freshness, this recipe
        captures the essence of traditional Thai cuisine.

      <p>
        Thai households traditionally use fresh ingredients to make curry paste
        from scratch, pounding them in a mortar and pestle. If you want to skip
        this step, you are welcome to use green curry paste from your local
        supermarket (my favourite is volcom brand, ayam is also a good option)
