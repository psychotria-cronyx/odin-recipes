    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Green curry chicken is a flavorful Thai dish that balances spicy, sweet,
      and savory elements. It combines tender pieces of chicken with fresh
      vegetables, simmered in a creamy coconut milk base infused with aromatic
      green curry paste, lemongrass, and kaffir lime leaves. The dish is
      typically served with jasmine rice, offering a rich and fragrant meal.
      Perfect for those seeking a blend of heat and freshness, this recipe
      captures the essence of traditional Thai cuisine.

    <p>
      Thai households traditionally use fresh ingredients to make curry paste
      from scratch, pounding them in a mortar and pestle. If you want to skip
      this step, you are welcome to use green curry paste from your local
      supermarket (my favourite is volcom brand, ayam is also a good option)

    <h2>Method</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Prepare the Green Curry Paste</li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Toast coriander and cumin seeds until fragrant. Add them to a mortar
          with the garlic, shallots, galangal, lemongrass, kaffir lime zest,
          cilantro stems, chilies, shrimp paste, and salt. Pound into a fine
          paste (or blend using a food processor with a bit of oil).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <li>Cook the Chicken</li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Heat the oil in a large pan or wok over medium heat. Add 1-2
          tablespoons of green curry paste and saut√© for 1-2 minutes until
          fragrant.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add the chicken and stir-fry until the chicken is lightly browned and
          coated in the paste.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <li>Simmer the curry</li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Pour in half the coconut milk, stirring constantly until the oil
          begins to separate from the milk. Add the remaining coconut milk and
          bring to a gentle simmer.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add the kaffir lime leaves, fish sauce, and palm sugar, stirring to
          combine. Taste and adjust seasoning (add more fish sauce for saltiness
          or sugar for sweetness).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <li>Add Vegetables</li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Add the Thai eggplants, snowpeas, and bamboo shoots, cooking for 5-7
          minutes until the vegetables are tender.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <li>Final Touches</li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Stir in the Thai basil and cook for another minute. Remove from heat
          and garnish with fresh chilies for extra heat if desired.
        </li>
      </ul>
